- Product editing/submitting experience
  - Handle saving failures more gracefully
  - Add failure states for image upload
  - Drag and drop to reorder doesn't work on mobile
  - Some more general styling improvements
- Lack of flex `gap` support on iOS and Safari for `<TagInput>` [#4](/../../issues/4)

### Feature Roadmap
- Sorting option on search
  - by popularity, recency, relevance (# of tags overlapping), etc.
- Continuous-value tags
  - Original price/MSRP
  - Actuation force
  - Search bounds to support these
- Ratings?
- NOT filters to exclude specific tags in searches
